Intuitively, the lower-order terms of an asymptotically positive function can be
ignored in determining asymptotically tight bounds because they are insignificant
for large n.

When n is large, even a tiny fraction of the highest-order term suffices to dominate the lower-order terms.

 asymptotically bounds a function from above and below

 When
 we have only an asymptotic upper bound,  big O
