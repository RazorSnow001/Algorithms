here is a big problem
why we can't find the thoughts for solving the problem with the divide and conquer algorithm ?
what's wrong with us ?

we should be very careful for some of the characters which the problem may indicates the
method will be  the divide and conquer !

1 the input is a list
2 and the output will like the
  merge sort  or quick sort
  or find the max subArray
  or find the common prefix of the
  string list
  we want  to handle the relationship
  between these elements

  the sorting !
  the max subArray
  the common prefix absolutely
  all these problem describe the relationship between the elements
  the sorting is about the relationship of the number

  so that is why we can use the fork join pool to handle the list problem
  which indeed implements the divide and conquer algorithm
  and the dynamic multi thread algorithm
  which just use the multiple thread to handle the problem . but it is a little different !
