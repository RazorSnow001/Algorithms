0,HDFS
1,that is a file system for the distributed system
2,for example in the distributed system . we start using many pieces of hardware
3,so here are big chance for the data losing if one hardware fail
4,so we need some you know copy operation to decrease risk
5,HDFS have such function but kind of different ?
6,the second problem is most tasks of the distributed system
7,the data comes from different ways
8,multiple sources MapReduce
9,Mapreduce do some abstraction of the file reads and writes
10,transforming into a computation over sets of keys and values
11,two parts of the computation the map and the reduce
12,reliable
13,scalable
14,storage big data
15,analysis big data
16,commodity hardware means some standared hardware not very special
17,open source
18,affordable
19,query all your data
20,MapReduce is a batch processing system
21,not suitable for interactive analysis
22,query typically take minutes or more
23,Hadoop evole beyond batch processing
24,
