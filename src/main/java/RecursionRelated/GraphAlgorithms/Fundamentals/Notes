Searching a graph means systematically following the edges of the graph so as to
visit the vertices of the graph.

A graph-searching algorithm can discover much
about the structure of a graph.

so when we talk about the graph
and the graph databases .we find the natual of the graph is to represent the relationship
so the natual is to touch the edge and the nodes
that is ok
elaborate on basic graph searching

Techniques for searching a graph lie at the heart of
the field of graph algorithms.
