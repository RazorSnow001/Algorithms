* for this classical problem we think we have the mission to do it very well
* 1 we can use the divide and conquer algorithm to divide the set to cover all possibilities
*   yes that is very great strategy
* 2 we can use the DP to handle it . that is a little hard to think .
*   but how to think about this way ?
