/*ok 1 we have noticed that --- a greedy algorithm can reduce the branches of the
*  dynamic programming . we just consider the best choice .so we just remain only
*  one selection . so the main case of the greedy algorithms is why ? not how ?
*  we have noticed that if you just look the current best choice .may leads to a
*  no global best choice .that is the case . but why ? that is the reason we needs to
*  read the books . ok that is very fascinating ! */
