/*that is a big project
 *
 * 1 we need the actually a program to generate matrix
 * 2 we need the program to do the matrix multiplication
 * 3 we need to generate chain of the matrix
 *   for example
 *   we need a chain with 100 matrix
 *   with random m * n
 *   but they can do the multiplication
 *   that is the constraint !
 *   input 5
 *   m * n is the result
 *   m* k * k* n*/
