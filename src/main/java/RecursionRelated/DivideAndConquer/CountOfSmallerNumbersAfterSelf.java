/* *    Leetcode 0315 Count of Smaller Numbers After Self
   *    The reverse of  the number array .
   *    that is very great problem .
   *    so this problem can be seen as the reuse of the reversedNum problem
   *    for example
   *    7 5 3 1
   *    3 2 1 0  so that is
   *    so for the sub problem we have 5 3 1 and we get the 2  but we actually use the merge sort to do that
   *    so 5 3 1 we get the 2 and 1 3 5 ok
   *    1 3 7 5
   *    0 0 1 0
