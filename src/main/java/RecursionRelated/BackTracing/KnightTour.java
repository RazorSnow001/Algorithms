* 1 give our a table
* 2 give the constraint of the knight movement
* 3 the knight can't return back .
* 4 we want the knight to traverse all the table .
* 5 display its first util the last movement .
* so that very problem can be seen as
* yi = x1x2...x64   yes the assignment for this value is actually not by the sequence according to
