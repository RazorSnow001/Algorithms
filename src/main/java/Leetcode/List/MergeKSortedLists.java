/*
 * that is the very interesting problem . which describe the
 * you know . the list of the arrays with the sorted numbers
 * and these sorted numbers we want to combine them
 * that is all .
 * so here are a lot of the methods to finish that
 * 1 using the divide and conquer to merge two list
 *   which is the result of the further recursion
 * 2 using the traditional index comparison technique to finish the job
 *   which means for each arrays in the list we add the index of the current of the array
 *   compare  and get the mini of that . move the index to further execution .
 * 3 ok that is the way !
 *   and here is another way to think about that !
 *   from the step two . so what is the priority queue in the java ?
